	It's a concurrency pattern used to:
	Fan-Out: Distribute work across multiple goroutines.
	Fan-In: Collect results from those multiple goroutines into a single channel.

	Insight:
	1. Channel safety: All workers share the same input and output channel â€” safe in Go due to internal locking in channels.
	2. WaitGroup is used to detect when all workers are done, and then close the output channel.
	3. Closing channels: Only close from the sending side, once all sends are done.
